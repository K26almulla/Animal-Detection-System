# 🐾 Animal Detection Using Machine Learning  

This project focuses on **wild animal detection around residential areas** using **machine learning** techniques. The goal is to **reduce animal attacks**, provide **early warnings**, and enhance **human-wildlife conflict mitigation** through automated detection systems.

## 📌 Project Overview

### 🚨 Problem Addressed  
Wild animal attacks pose a **serious threat** to human safety, especially in regions close to forests and wildlife habitats. Traditional deterrent methods are often **ineffective**. This project aims to develop an **AI-powered detection system** that can alert users in real time.

### 🔬 Technologies & Methodology  
- **Deep Learning Model** – Uses **DNN (Deep Neural Networks)** for accurate animal classification.  
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** – Real-time object detection algorithm to identify animals in images.  
- **Python & OpenCV** – For image processing and recognition.  
- **Anaconda & Jupyter Notebook** – Used as the development environment.  
- **Threading & Alert System** – Sends **email alerts** and **activates alarms** upon detection.  

## 🛠 Key Features  
✔ **Real-Time Animal Detection** – Detects animals in live video feeds.  
✔ **Automated Alerts** – Sends email notifications with detected animal details.  
✔ **Machine Learning-Based Identification** – Differentiates **hostile** and **non-hostile** animals.  
✔ **Security Integration** – Can notify authorities or residents when dangerous animals are detected.  

## 📊 Project Structure  
- **Dataset** – Contains labeled images of different animal species.  
- **Detection Algorithm** – Uses YOLO for object detection and OpenCV for image processing.  
- **Alert System** – Sends **real-time notifications** via email.
